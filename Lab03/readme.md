## Executive Summary
### Software
Operating system software is software which creates an interface between the hardware and the user. An example of this is Microsoft's Windows. Application software is are programs which do something useful for the user, such as Word or Photoshop. Utility software is software that allows you to maintain, modify, and fix your computer, and an example of this is Disk Cleanup on Windows. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software uses a central database that is implemented throughout an entire business. An example of an ERP system would be SAP's line of products. When it comes to virtualization's use, there are many applications. Mainly it is used to reduce costs and run mulitiple operating systems while having full control over each one. Virtualization difers froom cloud computing mainly because cloud computing is a service that delivers shared computing resorces while virtualization is a system independent from physical infrastucture.   
### Virtualization
With virtualization we solve the main problem of resource allocation, running multiple services through one server bank instead of multiple services through multiple banks. This saves time, money, and resources for other projects. A hypervisor is a software which is responsible for partitioning hardware that the virtual systems can use.  
### Python
What people mean by calling python 'psuedo code like' is that statements and variables are done diferently. You can write them as easily as saying x = 3 istead of having to state that x is a variable that is an integer such as int x. An interprited language is read line by line directly by the machine and a compiled language is first translated into machine code then read by the machine.
### Career Exploration
#### College Central
College Central seems to be a place that we, as students, can find jobs, internships, and co-ops all in one place. It also seems to have a wealth of other good things like a carrer portfolio and an area for all your resumes. 
#### Certifications
I am not in either networking or cybersecurity but in the future I do plan on getting Cisco certified in networking.
#### Certificates and Degrees

#### Co-ops / Internships
#### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
