## Executive Summary
### Python IDLE
##### Code Examples
1. A variable would be something like x = 2. X would be your variable and it is stored in RAM for later usage by the program. The author uses spam, eggs, and bacon to reference the Monty Python skit about spam.
2. An assignment statement would be something like y = 2 + x. You are assigning y a value based on previous inputs.
3. An example of a function is input(). It tells the console to read a users input.
4. Data types include int(), str(), and float(). Int is a whole number, string is a statement, and float can be a non-whole number.
### Graphics
##### Raster vs Vector
##### Lossless vs Lossy Compression
##### File Formats
##### File Properties
To make my logo it took 11 layers to complete it, and at only 60.4KB it's pretty small as well. I have chosen to open it with Chrome because thats what it supports as well as any other browser I have (Edge, Firefox, etc).
