## Executive Summary
In this lab we will learn about basic python principles and how different graphic files work as well as creating our own vector graphic.
### Python IDLE
##### Code Examples
1. A variable would be something like x = 2. X would be your variable and it is stored in RAM for later usage by the program. The author uses spam, eggs, and bacon to reference the Monty Python skit about spam.
2. An assignment statement would be something like y = 2 + x. You are assigning y a value based on previous inputs.
3. An example of a function is input(). It tells the console to read a users input.
4. Data types include int(), str(), and float(). Int is a whole number, string is a statement, and float can be a non-whole number.
### Graphics
##### Raster vs Vector
A raster image uses bitmaps and pixels to create an image. A vector image uses a series of mathematical commands to create images. A raster image is much larger than a vector image and can therefor be more detailed. However, a vector image can be continually enlarged without losing quality. Vector images are used for printing and where file size is important while raster images are used in nearly everthing else.
##### Lossless vs Lossy Compression
The difference comes down to how much space is availible for a given graphic. A lossless file will have far greater fidelity, but will have a much larger file size. When size is important developers will try to compress the images as much as possible while still maintaining a high degree of visablity.  
##### File Formats
Well for starters, they are all image formats. PNG is a lossless format while JPG images are made with lossy compression. Typically, JPGs are used in photography for many reasons. One such reason is the existencce of EXIF, a way of tagging digital photos making htem easier to group and find. PNGs are typically used where there are fewer colors blending together, and because of lossless compression, are supposedly higher fidelity. GIFs uses lossless compression like PNGs but use it for a different reason. A GIF can be animated and looped. Each frame of a GIF can support up to 256 colors, so it really isn't the best for color quality.
##### File Properties
To make my logo it took 11 layers to complete it, and at only 60.4KB it's pretty small as well. I have chosen to open it with Chrome because thats what it supports as well as any other browser I have (Edge, Firefox, etc). 
## Conclusion
This lab was fairly basic but learning about how images are catagorized was interesting and shows just how deep this stuff goes.
