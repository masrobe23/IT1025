### Internet Architecture
##### Internet Protocol
1. An IP address is the numerical label assign to each device connected to a network. The main diference between IPv6 and IPv4 is the amount of bits assigned to each address. IPv4 has 32 per while IPv6 has 128 bits per device.
2. ICANN is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and they are responsible for the cordination of maintainance and protocal for the domain names of the internet. They have a feature which allows you look up any domain and find registry details and nameservers. 
##### TCP/IP
1. The responsibility of TCP/IP is to interconnect a server with a client system and allowing that client system to access the information they need/want.
2. TCP/IP enables the client-server relation to be much faster and streamlined.
3. Layers are inmportant to changing technology because they allow the end user and developers to access their information much quicker. It allows us the ability to have other services work together and acheive whatever it is we need to do but faster. 
4. When it comes to the application layer many things are run on it. HTTP, FTP, SMTP and many more. Mainly it consists of web-based applications.
##### Internet Security
1. HTTP is the protocol used by the World Wide Web and it defines how webpages are formated and transmitted and what webpages should do given certain inputs. This is a great example of the server-client model as a client calls for the server to access a webpage to view.
2. HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP and what it mainly does is encrypt the data being sent from the server to the client and vice verse.
##### Securing your Web Browser
1. The main thing this does is help protect your computer from spyware and viruses, securing your browser can reduce these risks but not entirely negate them
2. One risk that is often taken is the use of cookies. Cookies are bits of data used by the website to track where you came from and what you are doing on the site. Mainly these are harmless, but, if the website uses these for authentication and an atacker gets ahold of the data from your cookies they can get unautherized access to that website.
