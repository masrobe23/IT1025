### Executive Summary 
In this lab we will learn about how databases opperate, how to contol them using SQL, and how to protect our own Intellectual Properties within the nature of the law.
### Data, Information and Knowledge
##### Relational Data
1. Data is literally just numbers, nearly useless on its own. Only when it is given context does it become information as it is now useful to more people. Once this information is understood and analyzed it becomes knowledge which can now be used to make informed decisions on various business topics.
2a. I think that the primary key between customers and orders would be a unique user ID for each customer.
2b. Through the order number connected to the user ID of the customer.
2c. Most likely this would be the actual items which were ordered by the customer.
3. Without specifing the data type the system may just not even work, and even without that thought, things might get pussed around incorrectly within the database.
##### Big Data
Volume: The mass quantity of data being handled at any one time.
Velocity: The timeframe of the data; seconds, minutes, hours, these matter to large corpertations.
Variety: The differing types of data being handled at any one time.
Veracity: How trustworthy and reliable the data is to a company.
When it comes to what has trusted big data into the spotlight it would most likely have to be data collection for advertising.
### Structured Query Language (SQL) 
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System which is basically just a structured database using rows and columns. SQL is used here to retrieve, add, and move database objects and generally make managing these beasts a little easier.
### SQL Injections
SQL injecting is a way of hacking into databases by tricking the database into running a SQL statement and hackers use this method to steal data and information. To reduce these types of issues by limiting the control of the user instead of letting them have free unautherized reign.
### Ethical and Legal Implications
##### Code of Ethics
1. A Code of Ethics outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional group. The ACM created their code because IT professionals should be held up to a certain standard of trustworthiness and honesty within the workplace.
2. The difference between a Code of Ethics and AUP is where it is used. A AUP is mainly followed only when on or using that entity's property or name while a code of ethics must always be followed where ever you go and in whatever you do. 
3. When it comes to AUPs a good example is YouTube's policies specifically their guidlines on privacy as I know that is one thing they take seriously. I know that if you ever find your personal information in a video or such without your consent, YouTube will take that video down quickly.

##### Intellectual Property
1. The WIPO maintains and protects intellectual properties from theft or misuse. They are extemely important to the world as they keep ones own developments and inventions clear of theft as long as it is registered. It also allows people to be creative and know their products or idea won't be stolen from them underneath the law.
2. In the US, in order to register a work for copyright you must go to the US Copyright Offices and apply for a copyright. The benefits you gn are truly tremendous in comparison to the time it takes. If your copyright is ever infringed by a person or entity, you can demand damages for the works and also gives prime evidence of your product being copywriten. It might be important to copyright my image incase anyone wanted to make money off either selling my logo or use it as their own without consent. 
3. The Trademark gives the IP a face or name and is equally as important as copyrighting the IP in terms of protection. This way no one may infringe upon any part of your business or your ideas without heavy repremands from the law.
##### Information Collection
There are mny acts that have been passed to help protect the privacy of certain people on the internet. One such is COPPA or the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act which protects children under the age of 13 from certain websites and advertising without perental consent. There is FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act which states that parents have a right to have access to their childrens educational information until they turn eighteen. Lastly there is HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act which gives patients specific rights to control their medical records, the institutions which maintain it must get permission to share it, and imposses penalties if they don't.  
### Conclusion
This lab was a lot of reading but most of it was interesting and new to me. I have been meaning to take a look at SQL for a while now and this gave me a great oppertunity to do so. Learning about IP protections was pretty cool, if a bit too bland for my tastes, and is extremely important to know about.
