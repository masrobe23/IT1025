### Lucidchart
The experience was pretty easy, however it is a site I would most likely no use. When it comes to program flowcharts I like to write it out on paper as it helps m ework through the information better.
### Introduction to Networking
##### Data Transmission
1. This is protocol, a series of commands defined and used by networks for communitation.
2. This is a packet, and just like physical packets, they hold data defined by the user.
3. This is an IP address. Everything that can connect to the internet has one and they identify what the device is. 
4. This is known as packet-switching, servers and routing points exchange packets to get them to their destination.
5. This is the DNS or Domain Name System. It acts like a phonebook, by giving the Name and IP address of a domain.
##### Networking Hardware
1. A hub and switch both connect multiple devices onto one network. The main difference is that a switch will check to who and where the data is supposed to go. A hub will send to everything on a network.
2. A router mainly connects a local network with other networks on the internet. It is also layer 3, meaning it reads IP addresses.
##### Network Topologies
1. Single point of faliure is when one break in a system could take it entirely down. The topolgies which experience this are bus, ring and dual-ring, star, and tree.
2. An infrastucture wireless topology uses wired topology with wireless topology to create a hybrid system allowing wired and wireless networks to work together. A wireless mesh network uses hundreds of wireless nodes which talk to each other to connect large areas. I think it really depends what your problems are. I personally like wireless mesh over ifrastructure as I feel it is the way of the future.
