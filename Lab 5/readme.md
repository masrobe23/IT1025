## Executive Summary
In this lab we will learn large swaths of things ranging from networking to cybersecurity and encryption. 

### Lucidchart
The experience was pretty easy, however it is a site I would most likely no use. When it comes to program flowcharts I like to write it out on paper as it helps me work through the information better.
### Introduction to Networking
##### Data Transmission
1. This is protocol, a series of commands defined and used by networks for communitation.
2. This is a packet, and just like physical packets, they hold data defined by the user.
3. This is an IP address. Everything that can connect to the internet has one and they identify what the device is. 
4. This is known as packet-switching, servers and routing points exchange packets to get them to their destination.
5. This is the DNS or Domain Name System. It acts like a phonebook, by giving the Name and IP address of a domain.
##### Networking Hardware
1. A hub and switch both connect multiple devices onto one network. The main difference is that a switch will check to who and where the data is supposed to go. A hub will send to everything on a network.
2. A router mainly connects a local network with other networks on the internet. It is also layer 3, meaning it reads IP addresses.
##### Network Topologies
1. Single point of faliure is when one break in a system could take it entirely down. The topolgies which experience this are bus, ring and dual-ring, star, and tree.
2. An infrastucture wireless topology uses wired topology with wireless topology to create a hybrid system allowing wired and wireless networks to work together. A wireless mesh network uses hundreds of wireless nodes which talk to each other to connect large areas. I think it really depends what your problems are. I personally like wireless mesh over ifrastructure as I feel it is the way of the future. 
##### Network Design
This is the design of my home's wireless network. Hopefully I will be upgrading it soon. 
##### NSA/CSS
The NSA is incharge of breaking and decrypting our enemies codes and cyphers. They also play a major role in the cyber-defenses of the US by trying to stay ahead of the curve in cryptology and cybersecurity. 
### Cybersecurity and Encryption
##### Information Systems Security
1. When it comes to the security triad first up is confidentiality and this would be not letting information, like names and addresses, be available to everyone within Amazon when someone makes a claim. With integrity this involes a) making sure their data remains unchanged without the customers notice, and b) if it is changed, being able to reverse that mistake. And avalibility would be the ability for customers to access thier sensitive data at anytime they want.
2. Getting into your phone is one as many people use a password. Logging on to a school or public computer. And, if still done, clocking into work. All of these could use biological means of becoming multi-factored such as your phone requiring a figerprint or your computer needing to see your face and even the cameras going into your workplace.
3. Both ACL and RBAC are types of permissions lists, breaking down who, what, and when things can access files or servers. What makes them different is use cases, ACL is on the more individual level and is more fleshed out, while RBAC is more on a grander scale for businesses with mainly a reader or writer tag.
4. A person who wants to send an encrypted message to someone who has the private key must fist aquire the public key. They then create their message and 'lock' it behind encryption that only the private key can decrypt known as cyphertext. This is then decrypted on the reciever's end by the private key and can then be read as plain text or what have you. 
##### Cryptography
1. The Ceasar Cypher takes the alphabet and shift the letters down in the sequence. If you have it set A to N your a's will become n's, b's will become o's, and so forth.
2.This shows the comminality of certain letters in the english alphabet and it makes a lot of sense. When it comes to other languages I feel they have their own letters that are used more frequently but this pattern can most likely be replicated in others.
3. The polyalphabetic cypher is eccensially a bunch of primitive Ceasar Cyphers but this employs a new method. A shift word is used to encrypt the message, moving over words by large factors. If I had the word bread and I had a shift word of bro the word bread would encrypt to ejtcv. Bro would be converted to the numbers 2-18-15 and these numbers would tell you how many letters to move down in the alphabet. Once the shift word goes through all three of its values it repeates until the items to encrypt are completely encrypted down. 
##### Brute-Force
Brute forcing is the act of forcing a guess loop into a system to break into password locked systems. It relates to Kerckhoffs's principle is that anything powerful enough doesn't need a decypher or deencrypter as brute forcing is like bashing a door down instead of picking the lock. You don't need to do something that time consuming if you don't have to.
## Conclusion
This lab was incredibly interesting as I have been wanting to learn more about cybersecurity and have been doing my own studies on the subject. Networking is a great thing to know no matter what part of IT you are going into as everything needs to work around your network.
