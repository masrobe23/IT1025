### Executive Summary 
In this lab we will learn about how and why file compression is used as well as what strengths there are to Object Oriented Programming. Alongside this we will learn why developers use Unified Modeling Language to comunicate.

### File Compression
1. The main reason for file compression is to make files smaller than the raw verisons. It can be used for multiple applications but is manily used for moving files as it becomes faster and easier to access.
2. For the SVG file it compressed to about half the size. If it were a JPG it would probably drop to about 1/10 the original size.
### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
1. The methods within the shark class are functions swim() and be_awesome().
2. Constructors are used to initialize data and is the first definition in a class.
3. A class is a blueprint that can be used to make objects. Objects are the actual instance of a class and how they are truly utilized.
### Unified Modeling Language (UML)
a1. OMG is the Object Management Group and they are responsible for creating standards for communication using UML between countless different industries.
a2. An Object would be swim(self)
A Class would be Shark 
Inheritence would be Sammy
Abstraction would be the definition of shark
Encapsulation would be a specific type of shark
### Conclusion
This lab was nearly useless to me until we got to UML design as I have never used it before. UML really allows developers to communicate in a way that isn't through speech, e-mail, and through their code as most coders I know hate looking at someone elses code. This lab will greatly benifit anyone who is going down the programming route.
