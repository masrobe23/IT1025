### Executive Summary
In this lab we will explore the basics of github fuctionality, how client-server architecture works, and what cloud computing is.
### Information System Components
A information service I use almost daily is Valve's Steam, an application that works as a marketplace and library for PC games. Hardware wise Valve uses large server structures to hold the data of not only its userbase, but also the games for sale. When it comes to software it would be the application itself alongside anything valve uses to maintain the servers. That in the server would be the aforementioned data collected for the users, what they buy, what they do, and what their PC's specs are. The people involved are those maintaining data bases, developers, Valve's higher ups, and us the consumers. And finally process would be the act of updating steam for new user functionality or the addition of new servers/databases.  
### GitHub
##### Client - Server Architecture
In the client-server structure our putting in code or uploading files would be the client side. When the server takes in that data and stores it for later use and pulling that would be the server side. Git desktop seems to make the client side easier for the average person, allowing the user to see changes eaiser and know what happened and when without going through many web pages.
##### Cloud Computing
GitHub is considered cloud computing because almost all the data and data management is handled by GitHub's servers. Another example of cloud computing would be most email services as we as the end user don't manage the direction of data ourselves. 
### Conclusion
In this lab we learned how information services actually worked which while mundane was rather interesting. We also looked at how client server architecture fuctions and most importantly what cloud computing is and how it works with us.
